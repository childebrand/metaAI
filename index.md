## Project Overview

This meta-analysis examines factors driving AI resistance across different markets, methods, and over time. We analyze how various characteristics of AI systems and their implementation contexts impact user acceptance and resistance.

### Key Research Questions

1. How context-dependent is people's aversion toward AI? We contrast various types of AI across application domains.
2. How have AI resistance vs. appreciation patterns evolved over time? We identify major inflection points of AI across time.
3. To which extent is AI resistance an artifact of how researchers study it? We demonstrate reduced effect sizes with increasing ecological validity.

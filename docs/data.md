This is my data test.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.



# Data
{: .no_toc }

Just the Docs has some specific configuration parameters that can be defined in your Jekyll site's \_config.yml file.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

---

View this site's [\_config.yml](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/tree/main/_config.yml) file as an example.

## Site logo

```yaml
# Set a path/url to a logo that will be displayed instead of the title
logo: "/assets/images/just-the-docs.png"
```

## Site favicon

```yaml
# Set a path/url to a favicon that will be displayed by the browser
favicon_ico: "/assets/images/favicon.ico"
```

If the path to your favicon is `/favicon.ico`, you can leave `favicon_ico` unset.
